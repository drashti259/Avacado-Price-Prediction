# Avacado-Price-Prediction
The project aimed to predict avocado prices using time series data sourced from Kaggle. Data cleaning and analysis were done to identify trends and seasonality. Naïve and Seasonal Naïve forecasting methods were implemented in R Studio to predict prices. The models were evaluated using error metrics like MAE and RMSE to assess accuracy.
